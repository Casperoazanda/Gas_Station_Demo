## What's included

- [x] Developed data analysis system with Spark, Kafka, ZooKeeper, MySQL, InnoDB, Flume, SpringBoot, and Echarts
- [x] Integrated data distributed on 30 servers to Kafka in JSON using Flume and implemented data ingestion and handling clusters in real-time processing using Kafka.
- [x] -Used ZooKeeper to co-ordinate cluster services.
- [x] Consume live data from Kafka topics with Spark Streaming to create continuous sequences of RDDs.
- [x] -Generated distributed computing Map and Reduce for RDD stream to improve writing speed to MySQL, and implement transaction features with InnoDB.
- [x] -Transfer offsets generated by Spark Streaming to MySQL and Implemented visualization with SpringBoot and Echarts.


### MySQL

This repo is using MySQL. We use MySQL to handle CRUD operations over
the Kafka offset, and to store station data.
